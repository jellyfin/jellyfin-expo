 * **NOTE** This test is currently disabled based on the following rationale
 * 
 * 1. There is a bug in the current version of react-native-webview which breaks
 *    jest tests.
 *    https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/issues/3506
 * 2. The downgraded version of react-native-webview (which fixes this test)
 *    introduces compatibility issues with the current version of react native
 *    and possibly expo, throwing this error when the home screen is loaded
 *    (after server login)
 *    ```
 *    TypeError: _NativeRNCWebView.default.shouldStartLoadWithLockIdentifier is not a function (it is undefined)
 *    ```
